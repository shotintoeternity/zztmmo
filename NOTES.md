# NOTES — escalations and decisions log (append-only)

- 2026-07-09: Project scaffolded. Baseline `engine/` (vendored from
  benhoyt/zztgo @ master, MIT) builds and passes its tests on go1.26.5,
  macOS arm64. Reference clones are gitignored; re-clone per CLAUDE.md if
  missing.

- 2026-07-09 (M0.4): The task/DoD note "SoundHasTimeElapsed still paces
  interactive mode" is inaccurate for the current code: zztgo stubs
  `SoundHasTimeElapsed` to `return true` (sounds.go), with the real timer logic
  commented out. The ONLY thing pacing interactive `GamePlayLoop` is the
  `time.Sleep(TickTimeDuration*10 ms)` at game.go:1490. So literally deleting
  that sleep would make interactive play run uncapped (DoD "interactive speed
  unchanged" would fail). DECISION: route the per-cycle pace through `Delay()`
  (removing the raw `time.Sleep` + `time` import from game.go) and make `Delay`
  a no-op when `Headless`. Interactive sleeps exactly as before; headless runs
  flat out. Fully moving the pace out to an interactive wrapper (so GameStep
  never paces) lands in M0.5. If/when `SoundHasTimeElapsed` gets real timing,
  revisit whether the Delay-based pace is still needed.

- 2026-07-09 (M0.5, [ADVISOR]): The advisor tool was unavailable this session
  (infra error on every call), so the required pre-edit advisor consult could
  NOT be done. Proceeded with user pre-authorization ("proceed with extra
  care"). Mitigation: cross-checked the extraction against GAME.PAS (1518-1590)
  before writing. Design: GameStep iterates the GLOBAL CurrentStatTicked
  (RemoveStat/DamageStat decrement it — GAME.PAS 942-943, 1233-1234), ticks the
  pending stats for the cycle, then advances CurrentTick (wrap >420->1), resets
  CurrentStatTicked, and calls InputUpdate. The wrapper is "pace (Delay), then
  if SoundHasTimeElapsed: GameStep()". The pause branch stays verbatim in the
  wrapper; the shared "all stats ticked" block folded into GameStep. The
  one-time advance the pause path used to get is reproduced by the next
  GameStep, and CurrentTick is re-randomized on unpause anyway, so the
  transition is unchanged. NOT hash-verified yet — the M0.6 replay fixture
  (next task) is what locks this pure; a manual TOWN.ZZT playtest is the interim
  DoD check. If M0.6's fixture reveals drift here, revisit GameStep.

- 2026-07-09 (M0.5 verification): Manual A/B playtest done — M0.4 binary vs
  M0.5 binary on TOWN.ZZT, side by side. Movement speed, monster behavior,
  the start-of-board pause/blink, and scroll open/close all feel identical.
  M0.5's interactive DoD ("feels identical") is MET. Still to be hash-locked by
  M0.6.

- 2026-07-09 (HANDOFF — read before continuing M0): M0.1–M0.5 are complete,
  committed, and green (`cd engine && go build ./... && go test ./...`). Next
  unchecked task is M0.6 (replay harness + fixtures). Seams now in place for
  M0.6 to build on:
    * `Headless bool` (video.go) — true = no terminal, no sleeps.
    * `Screen [80][25]{Ch,Color}` buffer + present_tcell.go presenter (M0.2).
    * `InputSource` interface + `ScriptedInput{Ticks,Pos}` + `SetInputSource`
      (input.go, M0.3) — drive input with no keyboard.
    * `RandSeed uint32` + `RandomSeed(s)` (lib.go, M0.1) — seed determinism.
    * `GameStep()` (game.go, M0.5) — one cycle, headless-callable in a loop.
    * `Delay()` is a no-op when Headless (M0.4).
  M0.6 recipe (from TASKS.md): new engine/replay_test.go with StateHash() =
  FNV-1a over Board.Tiles + all Stats fields + World.Info + RandSeed; then
  RandomSeed(42), load TOWN.ZZT, start play (GameStateElement=E_PLAYER,
  unpaused), drive 600 GameSteps with a fixed ScriptedInput, record StateHash
  every 100 steps into fixtures/town.replay.json (write if absent, compare if
  present); run twice to prove determinism. From then on it gates every commit.
  Note: TOWN.ZZT is present in engine/ but is NOT git-tracked (untracked working
  file) — the test loads it from the engine working dir.
  PROCESS: the advisor tool was unavailable for this entire session (infra
  error on every call). M0.6 is not [ADVISOR], but M1.3 and M2.2 are — try the
  advisor first, and if it is still down, escalate per CLAUDE.md rule 5 or get
  explicit user pre-authorization before editing (as was done for M0.5).

## M3.9 (2026-07-09) — the '?' key could hang the whole server

Found while starting M3.9: `ElementPlayerTick` case '?' called
`GameDebugPrompt`, which calls `PromptString`, which loops on
`InputReadWaitKey()`. That blocks on the package-global `keyChan`, fed only by
the tcell keyboard. In a headless room engine nothing ever feeds it, so a single
browser client pressing '?' would have blocked `RoomManager.StepDiffs` forever —
freezing every room and every player, not just the sender. M1.4's grep for
"zero TextWindow/SidebarPrompt/InputReadWaitKey calls in sim code" missed it
because the call site says `GameDebugPrompt`, not `PromptString`.

Fix follows the M1.3 scroll pattern: the sim emits `DebugPromptEvent{StatId}`
and returns; the caller collects the typed text and replies via
`Engine.SubmitDebugCommand(statId, text)`, applied at the top of the next
`GameStepWithInputs`. `GameDebugPrompt` (terminal/editor) keeps the modal
`PromptString` and now delegates to the new `GameApplyDebugCommand(statId,
input)`, which is the old body with `PlayerFor(0)`/`Stats[0]` replaced by the
triggering player — vanilla always meant stat 0, but a cheat must credit
whoever typed it.

Timing deviation: '?' now applies on the NEXT step rather than mid-tick. Same
class as the M1.3 scroll deviation. Replay fixture unchanged (the scripted
replay input never presses '?' or 'H'), so no `DEVIATION:` tag was required.

Also: `HelpEvent` gained `StatId`. Room events are broadcast to everyone on the
board, so without it player A pressing 'H' opened a help window on player B's
screen. `QuitPromptEvent` still has no StatId and still reads `PlayerFor(0)` —
left alone, it belongs to M4.3's quit/save/high-score pass.

The .HLP files are now git-tracked (`engine/*.HLP`), byte-identical to
`reference/reconstruction-of-zzt/DOC/*.HLP` (MIT, Epic's permission included) —
same provenance and precedent as the already-tracked `fixtures/TOWN.ZZT`. The
server reads them via the new `-help` flag / `zztgo.HelpDir`; the sim never
touches the filesystem, `HelpFileLines` runs on the protocol boundary.

## M3.10 (2026-07-09) — who is a scroll for?

`ScrollEvent.StatId` is the OBJECT running the ZZT-OOP code, because that is the
target `OopSend` needs for a hyperlink reply. It is not the player. Room events
are broadcast to everyone on the board, so without a second identity every
player on the board would get a modal window when one of them talked to the
vendor.

The toucher is not available where the scroll is emitted: `ElementObjectTouch`
only does `OopSend(-statId, "TOUCH")`, and the object runs that code on its own
later tick, by which point the call stack no longer knows who knocked. So the
touch procs now record it in `Engine.ScrollAudience[objectStatId] =
playerStatId + 1` (0 = nobody), consumed by `OopExecute` when it emits the
event. It is presentation routing only — never simulation state, absent from
StateHash — but it is indexed by stat id, so `reindexScrollAudienceAfterStatRemoval`
keeps both its keys and its values in step with the stat array on RemoveStat,
exactly as the Follower/Leader fixup does, and `BoardOpen` clears it.

`PlayerStatId = -1` means an object opened a scroll from its own code rather
than from a touch; those are shown to everybody, as in vanilla.

`PendingScrollReply`/`PendingScrollStatId` became the queue
`PendingScrollReplies`, since several players can now close a scroll on the same
tick. The terminal client submits through the same `SubmitScrollReply`.

Known gap, deliberately left: `!-FILE;text` lines (a hyperlink that opens
another help file rather than sending a label) are inert — `hyperlinkOf` returns
"" and Enter just closes the window. TOWN's scrolls do not use them. Wiring
them needs a client→server "open this help file" request; it belongs with M4.1's
text-window system.

Vendor is on TOWN board 2 ("Armory"), stat 2, at (21,9). Note that several other
boards also have a stat 2 whose `Data` string contains the vendor's code — the
element there is not E_OBJECT, so it is inert, but do not identify objects by
`Data` alone.

## Third-party world compatibility (2026-07-09) — verified, plus a loader crash

Prompted by "will this run other ZZT games?". Answer: yes for real `.ZZT`
worlds, and it is now checked rather than assumed. *Burger Joint* (1998, Museum
of ZZT, 23 boards, 57 stats) loads and runs 3000 headless steps via
`cmd/zzt-smoke`, no panic. Same seed twice → identical end state; a different
seed diverges, so the sim is genuinely seeded and not accidentally frozen. The
M0–M3 surgery did not bake in TOWN-specific assumptions.

Format gate is vanilla: `WorldLoad` (game.go:626) requires the leading `int16`
to be `-1`. A forged `-2` header (Super ZZT) is rejected through ZZT's own "You
need a newer version of ZZT!" path. That is faithful — real ZZT refuses Super
ZZT worlds too — not a gap to close.

FINDING (unfixed): a **malformed world panics the loader** rather than failing
cleanly. A hand-forged header declaring 200 boards produced
`panic: slice bounds out of range [:0] with length 3`. There is no bounds check
on `World.BoardCount` before the `boardId <= BoardCount` load loop at
game.go:658, and `BoardData` holds only `MAX_BOARD+1` = 101 slots. Being
precise about what was proven: the forged file was malformed in more than one
way, so what is demonstrated is *a malformed world panics*, not specifically
that the `MAX_BOARD` overflow is the trigger. Not compared against the Pascal —
`reference/` is gitignored and was not cloned.

Not exploitable today: `cmd/zzt-server` loads its world once from the `-world`
flag and ignores `JoinMessage.World`, so a client cannot make the server open an
arbitrary file. It becomes a crash vector the moment users can upload worlds,
which is M5.3 territory. Harden the loader before then.

## Open design question (2026-07-09) — world flags are global, players are not

`MAX_FLAG = 10` flags live once in `World.Info.Flags` (gamevars.go:105) and are
read/written by `WorldGetFlagPosition`/`WorldSetFlag` (oop.go:271,282). They are
therefore shared by every player in a room: a puzzle one player solves is solved
for all of them, and `#if flag` means "has anyone done this yet".

This is not a bug — nothing decided otherwise — but it is an unmade decision
that single-player worlds will expose immediately. ZZT-OOP was written assuming
exactly one player. Related: `?`/seek now resolves through `NearestPlayer`
(game.go:300,1336), which is identical to vanilla for one player and a design
choice for N.

Needs a policy before M5 (authoring) and arguably before M4.6 (full TOWN
playthrough). Candidates: keep flags global (co-op semantics, current
behavior); per-player flags (each player runs their own story, breaks shared
puzzles); or a per-flag declaration in the world. Deliberately not resolved here.

## M3.11 (2026-07-09) — save policy for a shared world

DECISION. The sim must never block, so `S` emits `SavePromptEvent{StatId}` and
returns; the caller answers via `Engine.SubmitSaveFilename(statId, name)`,
applied at the top of the next step. That seam is required regardless of policy,
because the terminal client keeps vanilla's modal save prompt.

What the *server* does with the reply is the policy question. Interim answer for
M3.11: **refuse**. The sim shows "Saving is disabled" and moves on. This commits
to no semantics that later work would have to undo.

TARGET (decided, not built here): a save should snapshot the whole room, and
other players should be able to load that snapshot and join it later. This is
already close — `RoomManager.world` (room_manager.go:10) is the authoritative
`TWorld`, kept in sync at room_manager.go:417-419, and `WorldSave`
(game.go:684) already writes the vanilla format. Loading one back is
`NewRoomManager(loadedWorld)`.

Why it is NOT in M3.11: the filename comes from the client. Writing a
client-supplied name to server disk is a path-traversal hole (`../../`), and it
needs its own sanitizing, storage location, snapshot listing, and join-by-name
flow. Bundling that into the change that restructures the player tick is how a
green replay test goes red for unrelated reasons. Tracked as M4.3a.

Note that a room snapshot necessarily captures *other players* — their stats are
in `World.Info` and their stat entries are on the board. Deciding whether a
reloaded snapshot respawns them, drops them, or freezes them is part of M4.3a,
not a detail to improvise.

## Correction (2026-07-09) — reference/ WAS cloned; the loader crash is faithful

The earlier entry today ("Third-party world compatibility") claims `reference/`
is "gitignored and was not cloned". **That is wrong.** Both
`reference/reconstruction-of-zzt` (11 `.PAS` files) and `reference/zztgo` are
present. The claim came from a shell `grep ... || echo "not cloned"` where the
grep searched `GAME.PAS` for `MAX_BOARD`, which actually lives in
`GAMEVARS.PAS`; grep exited 1 and the `||` fallback printed a false conclusion.
Lesson, since this will recur: never let an `||` fallback narrate a conclusion
it did not test.

With the Pascal actually consulted, the malformed-world panic is resolved:
`GAME.PAS:743-748` reads

    for boardId := 0 to World.BoardCount do begin
        BlockRead(f, World.BoardLen[boardId], 2);
        GetMem(World.BoardData[boardId], World.BoardLen[boardId]);
        BlockRead(f, World.BoardData[boardId]^, World.BoardLen[boardId]);
    end;

over `BoardData: array[0 .. MAX_BOARD]` (`GAMEVARS.PAS:139`, `MAX_BOARD = 100`).
There is no bounds check on `BoardCount` in the original either. So the Go
`WorldLoad` is a **faithful** port of an original ZZT bug, not a fork
regression. Vanilla would scribble past the array; Go panics instead, which is
strictly better behavior for the same broken input.

Consequences: do NOT "fix" `WorldLoad` — bounding the loop there is a behavior
change and would need a `DEVIATION:` line. The right shape is validation *before*
the loader (reject `BoardCount > MAX_BOARD`, short files, negative `BoardLen`)
on the untrusted-upload path only, leaving the faithful loader untouched for
worlds the operator supplies. Fold this into M4.3a / M5.3 rather than the
engine. A `// ZZT-QUIRK:` marker on the loop would be appropriate.
