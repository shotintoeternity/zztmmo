# NOTES — escalations and decisions log (append-only)

- 2026-07-09: Project scaffolded. Baseline `engine/` (vendored from
  benhoyt/zztgo @ master, MIT) builds and passes its tests on go1.26.5,
  macOS arm64. Reference clones are gitignored; re-clone per CLAUDE.md if
  missing.

- 2026-07-09 (M0.4): The task/DoD note "SoundHasTimeElapsed still paces
  interactive mode" is inaccurate for the current code: zztgo stubs
  `SoundHasTimeElapsed` to `return true` (sounds.go), with the real timer logic
  commented out. The ONLY thing pacing interactive `GamePlayLoop` is the
  `time.Sleep(TickTimeDuration*10 ms)` at game.go:1490. So literally deleting
  that sleep would make interactive play run uncapped (DoD "interactive speed
  unchanged" would fail). DECISION: route the per-cycle pace through `Delay()`
  (removing the raw `time.Sleep` + `time` import from game.go) and make `Delay`
  a no-op when `Headless`. Interactive sleeps exactly as before; headless runs
  flat out. Fully moving the pace out to an interactive wrapper (so GameStep
  never paces) lands in M0.5. If/when `SoundHasTimeElapsed` gets real timing,
  revisit whether the Delay-based pace is still needed.

- 2026-07-09 (M0.5, [ADVISOR]): The advisor tool was unavailable this session
  (infra error on every call), so the required pre-edit advisor consult could
  NOT be done. Proceeded with user pre-authorization ("proceed with extra
  care"). Mitigation: cross-checked the extraction against GAME.PAS (1518-1590)
  before writing. Design: GameStep iterates the GLOBAL CurrentStatTicked
  (RemoveStat/DamageStat decrement it — GAME.PAS 942-943, 1233-1234), ticks the
  pending stats for the cycle, then advances CurrentTick (wrap >420->1), resets
  CurrentStatTicked, and calls InputUpdate. The wrapper is "pace (Delay), then
  if SoundHasTimeElapsed: GameStep()". The pause branch stays verbatim in the
  wrapper; the shared "all stats ticked" block folded into GameStep. The
  one-time advance the pause path used to get is reproduced by the next
  GameStep, and CurrentTick is re-randomized on unpause anyway, so the
  transition is unchanged. NOT hash-verified yet — the M0.6 replay fixture
  (next task) is what locks this pure; a manual TOWN.ZZT playtest is the interim
  DoD check. If M0.6's fixture reveals drift here, revisit GameStep.

- 2026-07-09 (M0.5 verification): Manual A/B playtest done — M0.4 binary vs
  M0.5 binary on TOWN.ZZT, side by side. Movement speed, monster behavior,
  the start-of-board pause/blink, and scroll open/close all feel identical.
  M0.5's interactive DoD ("feels identical") is MET. Still to be hash-locked by
  M0.6.

- 2026-07-09 (HANDOFF — read before continuing M0): M0.1–M0.5 are complete,
  committed, and green (`cd engine && go build ./... && go test ./...`). Next
  unchecked task is M0.6 (replay harness + fixtures). Seams now in place for
  M0.6 to build on:
    * `Headless bool` (video.go) — true = no terminal, no sleeps.
    * `Screen [80][25]{Ch,Color}` buffer + present_tcell.go presenter (M0.2).
    * `InputSource` interface + `ScriptedInput{Ticks,Pos}` + `SetInputSource`
      (input.go, M0.3) — drive input with no keyboard.
    * `RandSeed uint32` + `RandomSeed(s)` (lib.go, M0.1) — seed determinism.
    * `GameStep()` (game.go, M0.5) — one cycle, headless-callable in a loop.
    * `Delay()` is a no-op when Headless (M0.4).
  M0.6 recipe (from TASKS.md): new engine/replay_test.go with StateHash() =
  FNV-1a over Board.Tiles + all Stats fields + World.Info + RandSeed; then
  RandomSeed(42), load TOWN.ZZT, start play (GameStateElement=E_PLAYER,
  unpaused), drive 600 GameSteps with a fixed ScriptedInput, record StateHash
  every 100 steps into fixtures/town.replay.json (write if absent, compare if
  present); run twice to prove determinism. From then on it gates every commit.
  Note: TOWN.ZZT is present in engine/ but is NOT git-tracked (untracked working
  file) — the test loads it from the engine working dir.
  PROCESS: the advisor tool was unavailable for this entire session (infra
  error on every call). M0.6 is not [ADVISOR], but M1.3 and M2.2 are — try the
  advisor first, and if it is still down, escalate per CLAUDE.md rule 5 or get
  explicit user pre-authorization before editing (as was done for M0.5).
