# NOTES — escalations and decisions log (append-only)

- 2026-07-09: Project scaffolded. Baseline `engine/` (vendored from
  benhoyt/zztgo @ master, MIT) builds and passes its tests on go1.26.5,
  macOS arm64. Reference clones are gitignored; re-clone per CLAUDE.md if
  missing.

- 2026-07-09 (M0.4): The task/DoD note "SoundHasTimeElapsed still paces
  interactive mode" is inaccurate for the current code: zztgo stubs
  `SoundHasTimeElapsed` to `return true` (sounds.go), with the real timer logic
  commented out. The ONLY thing pacing interactive `GamePlayLoop` is the
  `time.Sleep(TickTimeDuration*10 ms)` at game.go:1490. So literally deleting
  that sleep would make interactive play run uncapped (DoD "interactive speed
  unchanged" would fail). DECISION: route the per-cycle pace through `Delay()`
  (removing the raw `time.Sleep` + `time` import from game.go) and make `Delay`
  a no-op when `Headless`. Interactive sleeps exactly as before; headless runs
  flat out. Fully moving the pace out to an interactive wrapper (so GameStep
  never paces) lands in M0.5. If/when `SoundHasTimeElapsed` gets real timing,
  revisit whether the Delay-based pace is still needed.
